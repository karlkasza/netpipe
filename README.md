# netpipe
Universal TCP forwarder

This program was written by me at the XMAS of 2003 (ancient!).
It solves a problem I had: I needed to be able to connect from the ouside to the inside of a firewall.
I could init a connection from inside and rebuild it periodically and use PPP over SSH as a VPN solution.
